								<h2 class="welcome">Hey, my name is Alex Jessome.</h2> 
								<p>Welcome to my portfolio. <br/>
								I'm a first year Web Development student at NSCC<br/>
								with a passion for the outdoors, photography and film</p>

								<h2>Goals</h2>
							</header>
							<h3>Short-Term</h3>
							<p>For me, the next two years of my life are about learning and growing as a person. I intend to graduate with my diploma from Nova Scotia Community college in 2020,
							   after which I hope to find meaningful and engaging employment in the software development field. Whether I end up at a large company or a tiny start-up, my priority 
							   is to surround myself with like-minded and driven people who can help me develop the skills necessary to thrive in this industry. During this time I plan on
							   working towards developing one or more exciting and hopefully profitable programs on the side. 
							</p>
							<h3>Long-Term</h3>
							<p>Over the course of the next five years, I hope to have the opportunity to work for at least two entirely separate organizations.
								I believe it is easy to become stuck in one place, so I plan on being proactive with my career. I want to be able to change and look at things in new ways, and I believe the best way
								to do so is to hear as many different points of view as possible. 
								I intend to remain on the cutting-edge of the industry and to keep up with the newest and most exciting innovations. Ideally, after 5 years I will be able to pursue my dream
								of founding my own start-up. 

								On a personal level I hope to tavel more, and to find a way to combine my love of photography with my work as a developer.
